The Office of Student Affairs and Services (OSAS) strengthened its support                        to CvSU’s quest for global recognition and excellence in service by continuous                        monitoring and evaluation of its services, taking into consideration the identified                        weaknesses and points for improvement. Proposals for institutionalized conduct of                        graduate tracer studies and the implementation of regular and periodic monitoring                        and evaluation of student services were prepared and submitted for presentation                        to the administrative council.                                Close coordination and consultation with students regarding their welfare                        and  development  were  implemented  by  conducting  consultative  meetings  and                        dialogues. The Student Council officers are invited to attend the faculty meeting so                        that  they  can  give  updates  on  the  developments  about  the  welfare  and  even                        problems of the students.

By its records, an                agency authenticates and keeps track of its day to day activities.  Records also provide                the material for planners and implementers of future operations.  Hence, the management                and tracking of records should be properly operated to better achieve one of the primary                functions of modern day organization – getting the right information, from the right person                at the right time and at a reasonable cost.  Moreover, to ensure the effectiveness of this                function, proper system in records keeping and records tracking are necessary.  The                processing, use, maintenance, storage and retrieval of these records are to be monitored                closely.                 RECORDS MANAGEMENT IN GENERAL                         Records Defined                                Records refer to  “any paper, book, photograph, motion picture, film, micro-                        film, sound, recording, drawing, chart, map or other document of any physical form                        or copy thereof that has been made or received by any entity or its successors as                        evidence  of  the  objectives  organizations,  functions,  policies,  decisions,                        procedures, operations, or other activities of the government or because of the                        information contained therein”.

Tickler or follow up correspondence                 THE RECORDS OFFICE                         The Records office serve as the receiving and releasing arm of the university for                official  correspondence,  reports,  memorandum  and  financial  documents.    It  assigns                reference number for each document received to identify the communication and the date                of receipt as well as to facilitate recording and location of communication.  Moreover, it                facilitates the fast transmission and routing of communication to the next action unit.  It                          Area X: Administration","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                  authenticates, classifies, indexes, and files official documents of the university.  It is also                responsible for the disposing papers that are no longer needed in accordance with the                existing  rules  and  regulations.    It  also  monitors  the  weekly  accomplishment  of                administrative personnel and submits reports to OVPASS.  Finally, it provides accurate                information  on  the  exact  location    or  status  of  document  within  the  offices  of  the                administration.                         The person in charge of the records office is the Records Officer who is responsible                for recording and tracking of documents received and released in the university.                         There are two major classifications of documents in the existing system.  These                are correspondence and financial documents.  These documents are entirely different                from each other, thus, they are recorded on separate logbooks.                         On the other hand, correspondence are written communications which are further                classified  into  incoming  and  outgoing  communication  (See  Figure  8).    Incoming                communications are those coming from outside the office while outgoing communications                are those that originate from the office.                  FLOW OF COMMUNICATION                         Incoming documents are forwarded to the Records Office for evaluation, stamping                and  assignment  of  document/reference  number.    Documents  are  stamped  with  date                received and initialed by the receiving personnel. (See Figure 8.1).  Important information                about the document is recorded in the logbook including the origin, the particulars of the                request, the date of receipt, the office sent to and the date of release. (See Figure 8.2).                The  communication  is  forwarded  to  OVPASS  or  OVPAA  for  recommending  approval                depending  upon  the  nature  of  the  incoming  communication.    Documents  that  are                academic in nature are forwarded to OVPAA while documents that are administrative in                nature are forwarded to OVPASS for appropriate action.  Before signing however, the                documents are checked if they are in order.  In the event that there is a need for some                clarification,  or  there  are  some  requirements  that  need  to  be  complied  with,                OVPAA/OVPASS send back the communication to the Records Office.  The Records                Office in turn, sends the communication back to the origin after the date of release and                remark/notation of the signing officer has been recorded in the logbook.  After complying                with the remarks/requirements, the document is then returned to the Records Office, after                which  the  same document  will  be  transmitted  to  OVPAA/OVPASS  for recommending                approval and finally to the OP for approval.                         Upon approval, the communication is returned to the Records Office wherein the                same  shall  be  released  to  the  office,  individual  concerned  after  such  action  of  the                document has been recorded in the logbook including the date of release. (See Figure                8).                 FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS                          Area X: Administration","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                           Included in financial documents are Request and Issue Voucher (RIV), Request                for Allotment (ROA), Disbursement Voucher (DV), and Payroll.                 FLOW OF FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS                         Financial  documents usually  start as  a  Request  and  Issue Voucher (RIV) or a                Disbursement  Voucher  (DV)  coupled  with  Request  for  Allotment  (ROA).    Upon                submission to the Records Office, the Records Officer evaluates all the documents (See                Figure  7.1).    All  required  signatures  and  required  documents  are  scrutinized  as  to                completeness.    RIV  with  incomplete  requirements  are  sent  back  to  origin.    After                ascertaining the completeness of requirements, the same is acknowledges receipt by                indicating the date of receipt as well as the initial of the receiver (see Figure 7.1.1).  A                reference number is assigned to each document.  Other necessary information such as                the origin, date received, particulars, total amount and requisitioner or claimant are then                recorded  in  the  financial  logbook  (see  figure  7.1.2).  A  routing  slip  is attached  to  the                document where the tracking information is recorded.  Date of receipt and release in each                of the offices where documents are forwarded are clearly indicated in the routing slip.                         After recording the needed information about the financial document on hand, it is                forwarded to the Supply Office.  As aforementioned, the receiving personnel indicate the                date of receipt on the Routing Slip.  The Supply Officer approves, signs and releases the                document to the Budget Office for appropriate funding.                         The Budget Office appropriate funds based on the amount requested as reflected                on the Request for Obligation of Allotment (ROA).  The date of release, any remarks about                the document and the office where it originated were recorded in the Routing Slip and                eventually the funded RIV and ROA are forwarded to the Supply Office for canvassing.                         The Supply Office facilitates the serving of approved PO/WO to winning bidders                (see figure 7.6).  The supplier delivers the items and the designated inspectors check the                items  according  to  specifications  indicated  in  the  RIV.    As  soon  as  all  the  required                signatures and supporting documents are complied with, disbursement voucher is them                prepared by the Supply Office and forwarded to the Office of the Internal Audit for auditing                purposes.                         Audited  disbursement  vouchers  are  forwarded  to  the  Accounting  Office  for                obligation and corresponding accounting entry and eventually released to the Cashier’s                Office for check preparation.  The Cashier’s Office facilitates the preparation of check                coupled with advice of checks issued.  The authorized signing officer signs the check.                Finally, the cashier file the documents and release the check to the claimant see figure                7.8).

The life and records may be likened to the life of a man.  A man is born,                         lives an active life and later retires and dies.  A record is created, maintained and                         later stored and disposed.                                Thus, there are three phases of Records Management:                             a)  Records creation (birth)                                  It is the phase of organizational operations where exchange of written                                communications between two sources thereby starting the life cycle of the                                record.

Corresponding (e.g. plain letters, endorsements)                                  2.  Administrative issuances (e.g. directives, circulars, orders)                                  3.

During the discussion, Dr. Vida suggested to look into the possibility                        of creating a Technology Business Incubator (TBI) in the campus.  Through this,                        technologies to be developed can easily be commercialized.                         Prof. Sedigo advised the dean to collaborate with some agencies most especially                        on marine technologies.  These areas may include the operationalization of coastal                        water resources, capacity building and aggressive recruitment of graduates.                                                                   Prof. John Xavier Nepomuceno, Naic Campus                         Dr. Robles said that Naic Campus can conduct fishery resources research since it                        was identified as NUCAF.  As such, it can concentrate on developing the pawikan                        sanctuary  and  can  work  on  international  linkages  such  as  JICA,  JOCB,  and                        PEMSEA. It can also work on the establishment of Marine Biological Research                        center.

The  University,  just  like  any  other  institution,  also  has  its  share  of  issues  and                problems that it needs to address in order to achieve excellence in research, development                 and extension (RDE). The present challenges are:                         •  Manpower.  One of the pressing management issues of the University is how to                            motivate its individual faculty members who are mostly overloaded with academic                           work to engage in RDE projects.                         •  Organizational  structure.  There  is  a  need  to  evaluate  the  current  RDE                            structure, to check if it is still adequate enough to maintain the RDE stature of                            the University.                          Area X: Administration","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                         •  Facilities. There is still a need to establish acquire additional research space and                            purchase state of the art equipment.                         •  Funding/Grants/Donations. Additional funds or grants should be sought from                            external sources to supplement the limited funds coming from the University.                        •  Information  system.  There  is  a  need  to  improve  the  dissemination  of  the                            University’s research outputs.                         •  Research, Development and Extension Agenda and Programs. There is a                           need to review the RDEAP of the University to ensure that it will continue to                            address the needs of the industry, the stakeholders and the community.                         •  Monitoring and Evaluation (M\&E) Program. There is a need to enhance the                           database, hire and train M\&E staff and develop an appropriate and functional M\&E                            system.                         •  Research  and  publication.  The  University  should  have  its  refereed  journal                            recognized by CHED, so that it could have an accessible medium by which it could                           publish its research innovations and outputs, making these more accessible to the                            public and industry.                         The  goal  is  to  become  a  Research  University  with  high  impact  (nationally-  and                 internationally-recognized)  research  and  development  and  cooperative  extension  (RDE)                programs.                         To be able to realize the University's RDE thrusts and contribute to the aspiration of                 CvSU to become a Global University by 2020, strategic actions for the next five years were                designed  to  serve  as  a  guide  of  RECETS  including  the  colleges  and  campuses  of  the                 University.

The University, just like any other institution, also has its share of issues and problems                that  it  needs  to  address  in  order  to  achieve  excellence  in  research,  development  and                 extension (RDE). The present challenges are:                         •  Manpower.  One of the pressing management issues of the University is how to                           motivate its individual faculty members who are mostly overloaded with academic                            work to engage in RDE projects.                         •  Organizational  structure.  There  is  a  need  to  evaluate  the  current  RDE                            structure, to check if it is still adequate enough to maintain the RDE stature of                           the University.                         •  Facilities. There is still a need to establish acquire additional research space and                            purchase state of the art equipment.                         •  Funding/Grants/Donations. Additional funds or grants should be sought from                           external sources to supplement the limited funds coming from the University.                         •  Information  system.  There  is  a  need  to  improve  the  dissemination  of  the                            University’s research outputs.                        •  Research, Development and Extension Agenda and Programs. There is a                            need to review the RDEAP of the University to ensure that it will continue to                            address the needs of the industry, the stakeholders and the community.                        •  Monitoring and Evaluation (M\&E) Program. There is a need to enhance the                            database, hire and train M\&E staff and develop an appropriate and functional M\&E                            system.                         •  Research  and  publication.  The  University  should  have  its  refereed  journal                            recognized by CHED, so that it could have an accessible medium by which it could                          Area X: Administration","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                         •  publish its research innovations and outputs, making these more accessible to the                            public and industry.                          The  goal  is  to  become  a  Research  University  with  high  impact  (nationally-  and                 internationally-recognized)  research  and  development  and  cooperative  extension  (RDE)                programs.

CvSU-STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM                 A. Rationale                         Cavite State University recognizes the importance of employees in achieving                is  organizational  goals.  It  considers  their  faculty  members  and  employees  as                strategic assets who must continuously enhanced for them to stay committed in                producing outstanding work performances. As their level of productivity increases,                    it  also  helps  improve  the  educational  institution’s  performance  in  achieving  its                goals and objectives.                         As a higher public educational institution, CvSU must attract, motivate and                retain competent administrators, faculty members and employees in performing                their tri-fold functions of instruction, research and extension in executing their                unique role of providing access to education to the least advantaged individuals in                areas  where  there  are  few  private  schools  and  in  offering  priority  programs                necessary for national development.                         To  make  sure  that  the  university  will  uphold  the  highest  standards  of                performances of all its faculty members and employees, the establishment of a                         Area X: Administration","PROGRAM PERFORMANCE PROFILE                   sound performance evaluation system shall be administered to continually foster                the improvement of individual employee efficiency and organizational effectiveness                through the Strategic Performance Management System (SPMS).                         SPMS  is  focused  on  linking  individual  performance  vis-à-vis  the  vision,                mission and strategic goals of the university. It will be the tool for ensuring that                the  functions  of  the  various  colleges/campuses  and  units  and  their  faculty                members and employees are fulfilled as expressed based on the set standards of                the institution.                         It  will  also  serve  as  a  mechanism  to  ensure  that  employees  achieve  the                objectives set by the University. On the other hand, CvSU will then achieve the                objectives that it has set itself in its strategic plan. Thus, performance management                function will become the heart of the CvSU human resource management system.                Information that will be derived from it will be useful in human resource planning,                management and decision making processes of Cavite State University.                 B.
